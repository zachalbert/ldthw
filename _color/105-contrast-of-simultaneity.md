* Strange visual effects
* Eye will generate a given color's complement if not present (neutral gray in the middle of orange will look bluish)
* Visual influence of a color nearby, make red appear more red by appearing next to cyan
* Light objects appear brighter against a dark background than vice versa
* How red is red? The answer is, it depends on what's around it.

## Exercises

1. Open up the design document with all 7 contrast frames that you started in the [contrast overview lesson]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _color/070-contrast-overview.md %}).
2. Zoom into the "simultaneous-contrast" frame.
3. In this frame, you're going to explore one of the really strange visual effects associated with simultaneous contrast. Start by giving the frame a background fill of `#2B2B2B`.
4. Now, draw a rectangle that is 20px wide, and 600px tall. Position it at coordinates (x: 185, y: 0).
5. Give that tall rectangle a fill of `#C4C4C4`.
6. Now create two duplicates of the tall rectangle and position them at (x: 390, y: 0), and (x: 595, y: 0), respectively.
7. You should now have 3 light gray rectangles evenly distributed in the frame. Next, you'll do the same, but for 2 horizontal rectangles. Create a copy of one of tall rectangles and rotate it by 90Â°, either by typing 90 in the rotation field of the design panel, or by rotating from the corner of the object while holding `shift`.
8. Make the new horizontal rectangle 800px wide, and then position it at (x: 0, y: 210).
9. Create a duplicate of the horizontal rectangle, and position it at (x: 0, y: 410).
10. You may already be noticing some strange visual effects, but there's one final step. Draw a 40x40 circle, and give it a pure white fill color of `#FFFFFF`. Move it right on top of any one of the intersections of the horizontal and vertical rectangles. You can use the red alignment guides that pop up when moving the shape to make sure it's centered.
11. Create duplicates of the white circle, and move them over the other intersections. You should have 6 circles total.
12. Now, the composition is complete. Stare at a single white circle, and try to simultaneously perceive the color of the other circles. Shift your gaze around to the other circles and try to keep noticing the same white color in each of the circles. You may need to zoom in or out to see the effect, but what is likely happening is the white circles in your periphery are shifting toward gray.
