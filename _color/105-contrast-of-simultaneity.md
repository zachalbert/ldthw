The contrast of simultaneity is the strangest contrast we're going to talk about. It deals with our eye's inability to perceive color independently, and the tendency for color perception to always be tweaked by other colors we perceive simultaneously.

For instance, one practical application of the contrast of simultaneity is by using complements. You can make the purest red appear *even more* red by surrounding it with its complement. The complement of cyan will provide a lot of contrast, and has the strange effect of intensifying the base red.

### "Missing" Colors

A common illustration of this type of contrast is to show a medium neutral gray square in a field of vibrant color. If you look carefully at the gray square, it will tend to take on the color of the opposite of the color surrounding it.

In the illustration below, both gray squares are the same color. The one on the left will probably appear cooler, almost cyan-tinged. The one on the right will probably appear warmer, with more of an orange/red cast to it.

## Exercises
This exercise will illustrate one of the strangest effects of simultaneous color perception.

1. Open up the design document with all 7 contrast frames that you started in the [contrast overview lesson]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _color/070-contrast-overview.md %}).
2. Zoom into the "simultaneous-contrast" frame.
3. In this frame, you're going to explore one of the really strange visual effects associated with simultaneous contrast. Start by giving the frame a background fill of `#2B2B2B`.
4. Now, draw a rectangle that is 20px wide, and 600px tall. Position it at coordinates (x: 185, y: 0).
5. Give that tall rectangle a fill of `#C4C4C4`.
6. Now create two duplicates of the tall rectangle and position them at (x: 390, y: 0), and (x: 595, y: 0), respectively.
7. You should now have 3 light gray rectangles evenly distributed in the frame. Next, you'll do the same, but for 2 horizontal rectangles. Create a copy of one of tall rectangles and rotate it by 90Â°, either by typing 90 in the rotation field of the design panel, or by rotating from the corner of the object while holding `shift`.
8. Make the new horizontal rectangle 800px wide, and then position it at (x: 0, y: 210).
9. Create a duplicate of the horizontal rectangle, and position it at (x: 0, y: 410).
10. You may already be noticing some strange visual effects, but there's one final step. Draw a 40x40 circle, and give it a pure white fill color of `#FFFFFF`. Move it right on top of any one of the intersections of the horizontal and vertical rectangles. You can use the red alignment guides that pop up when moving the shape to make sure it's centered.
11. Create duplicates of the white circle, and move them over the other intersections. You should have 6 circles total.
12. Now, the composition is complete. Stare at a single white circle, and try to simultaneously perceive the color of the other circles. Shift your gaze around to the other circles and try to keep noticing the same white color in each of the circles. You may need to zoom in or out to see the effect, but what is likely happening is the white circles in your periphery are shifting toward gray. Color vision is weird, huh?

That concludes the series of lessons on the 7 color contrasts. You may want to keep this design file handy to refer back to, but we are finished adding to it for now.
