Over the next two lessons, you're going to be learning about the color wheel, an invaluable tool to understand the relationships between colors. You'll do this by creating your own from scratch.

Before you start building a color wheel, you have to first decide whether or not you're going to use an additive color wheel, or a subtractive one. They both look similar, but lead to different conclusions.

### A Test of Opposites

Most people are taught about "color opposites" at some point in school (the official term is "color complements"). You've probably heard things like "the opposite of red is green" or "the opposite of blue is orange." What you don't often realize is that while this is true, it's *only* true for subtractive color like paint and ink.

With additive color models like `RGB`, the opposite of red is not green, but *cyan*, green's opposite is magenta, and blue's opposite is yellow. If you're paying attention, you might have noticed that these opposites represent the CMY in CMYK.

In future lessons, we'll be discussing complementary colors in greater depth. The quick takeaway is that complementary pairs of colors provide the greatest amount of hue contrast possible, so it's important to know that you're using the right color while for the output medium you're designing for.

In the next exercise, you're going to be creating your own `RGB` color wheel, which will help you understand the underlying numbers used in color models, and how pleasing color harmonies are achieved.
