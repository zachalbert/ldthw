In this lesson, you're going to lose some cherished beliefs you may still be holding on to from your early years. You'll be creating your own color wheel from scratch, which is invaluable tool to understand the relationships between hues.

During the course of the next two lessons, you'll learn that the most popular theory of color opposites and primary colors only applies in certain situations.

### A Test of Opposites

Most people are taught about "color opposites" at some point in school (the official term is "color complements"). You've probably heard things like "the opposite of red is green" or "the opposite of blue is orange." What you may not realize is that while this is true, it's only true when *mixing* physical color like paint and ink.

With additive light-based color spaces like `RGB` (which is used in the screen you're reading on right now), the opposite of red is not green, but *cyan*. Green's opposite is magenta, and blue's opposite is yellow. If you're paying attention, you might have noticed that these opposites represent the `CMY` in `CMYK`.

### RYB vs RGB

Use red, yellow, and blue as primaries when mixing paint, and red, green, and blue when working with digital color. In the next exercise, you're going to be creating your own color wheel using `RGB` primaries.

Creating this wheel will give you a greater sense of control over color, and help you understand how to achieve pleasing color harmonies in the `RGB` color space.
