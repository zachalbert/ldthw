Creating a color palette is an exploratory process that requires you to look at many variations before settling on a final arrangement. While you will be thinking about which hues go well together, you'll also need to decide on the saturation and brightness of those hues. Creating tints, shades, and tones will help you look at many saturation and brightness permutations of a color.

| **Tint** | *A tint is a color variant with **white** mixed in.* |
| **Shade** | *A shade is a color variant with **black** mixed in.* |
| **Tone** | *A tone is a color variant that has been desaturated to make it more **gray**.* |

This exercise will explore how to create **tints**. When exploring color palettes, you should always look at at least a few tinted variations of a color before settling on a final decision.

## Exercise

1. In a new design document, draw a circle of any size and paste this hex value in the fill color: `#407A80`.
2. Create 4 copies of the circle immediately to the right. If you hold `alt/option` while dragging, you can quickly create several copies. You should now have 5 circles. You're now going to add varying degrees of white to each of the circles.
3. In the second circle from the left, open the color dialog and *decrease* the saturation by 10 to 40, and *increase* the brightness by 10 to 60. You can either type the values directly, using the arrow keys on your keyboard, or hold `shift` while tapping the arrow keys to move the values in increments of 10.
4. Follow the same pattern for the other 3 circles, decreasing the saturation by 10 and increasing the brightness by 10 each time. The last circle should be close to pure white.

In the next exercise, you're going to create shades using the same methodology. Hang on to this design document.
