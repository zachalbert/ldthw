Creating a color palette is an exploratory process that requires you to look at many variations before settling on a final arrangement. While you will be thinking about which hues go well together, you'll also need to decide on many other components of the color palette. <!-- Might want to link back to Hue definition, or define it alongside your tint, shade and tone cheatsheet below. -->

### Tints, Shades, and Tones

Tints, shades, and tones are three common methods for modifying a single hue. When creating a new color palette, it's common to generate at least a few tint, shade, and tone variants for the core colors in your palette. These variants are usually required later in the design process. For instance, one problem you'll probably run into eventually is trying to use a core brand color for links. Your color might look vibrant when used for buttons, but washed out when used for text links since text has less "mass." In cases like this, you may have to use a shaded variant to make the text appear optically consistent with other uses of the brand color.  <!-- Feels like this is a great time to reference/illustrate color perception from your color psychology chapter. -->

Here's a tint, shade, and tone cheat sheet:

| **Tint** | *A tint is a hue variant with **white** mixed in.* |
| **Shade** | *A shade is a hue variant with **black** mixed in.* |
| **Tone** | *A tone is a hue variant that has been desaturated to make it more **gray**.* |

## Exercise
This exercise will explore how to create **tints**. Shades and tones will be explored in the next lessons.

1. In a new design document, draw a circle of any size and paste this hex value in the fill color: `#407A80`.
2. Create 4 copies of the circle immediately to the right. If you hold `alt/option` while dragging, you can quickly create several copies. You should now have 5 circles. You're now going to add varying degrees of white to each of the circles.
3. In the second circle from the left, open the color dialog and *decrease* the saturation by 10 to 40, and *increase* the brightness by 10 to 60. You can either type the values directly, using the arrow keys on your keyboard, or hold `shift` while tapping the arrow keys to move the values in increments of 10.
4. Follow the same pattern for the other 3 circles, decreasing the saturation by 10 and increasing the brightness by 10 each time. The last circle should be close to pure white.

In the next exercise, you're going to create shades using the same methodology. Hang on to this design document.
