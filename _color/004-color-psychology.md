Color psychology, as it's commonly described, is the belief that the presence of certain colors in our environment will affect our behavior. While reliable evidence does exist that color has an effect, it's a subtle one that is specific to an individual.

As it relates to brands, the Gestalt Law of Past Experience gives us an indication of the effect and extent of color psychology. Understanding this law will allow you to use this principle to your advantage in your design work. This law says that we tend to group our perceptions with similar things we've experienced in the past.

This gives us a sense of expectation about new experiences so that we only tend to notice brands that break the mold. Using neon pink and yellow for a bank would look odd to most people, but nobody would notice if that same pink & yellow combo was used for a snow cone shack.

Popular descriptions of color psychology usually break down when they claim that specific colors have the ability to evoke a specific emotion in a person. Statements such as “red equals passion” or “blue means stability” may evoke emotions, but those emotions will be different for each person depending on their preferences, cultural background, religion, social stigma, and a host of other things.

Due to the shaky evidence about specific emotion, pay more attention to the way people group similar brands together. The exercise is going to ask you to think about how brands represent themselves through color, and to extract patterns that you can reuse.

## Exercises

1. Write down 5 popular luxury brands, and 5 popular kid / youth oriented brands. Copy and paste logos and other brand materials into a design document so that you can easily see the colors most commonly used by each brand.
2. In your document, draw 3 color squares for each brand. For the fill color, sample the 3 most common colors you see used for each brand. You should have 15 color squares for luxury brands, and 15 for youth brands.
3. Analyze the patterns you see. Which brands conform to a mold? Which break it?
4. Finally, create a 3-color palette for a fake brand that conforms to the patterns you see. Pick one palette for a fake luxury brand, and one for youth brand. You can use this technique to quickly pick the colors for a new brand that "fit" a category, or the reverse of this technique if your goal is to grab attention.
