## Exercises

1. Open up the design document with all 7 color harmony frames that you started in the [color harmonies lesson]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _color/035-color-harmonies-overview.md %}).
2. Zoom into the "triadic" frame.
3. Select the red circle, and make 2 copies to the right.
4. Triadic harmonies are fairly easy to create. You only need to add or subtract 120° to the base color to get 3 colors equally spaced around the color wheel. Select the second red circle, and add 120 to the hue.
5. Select the third red circle, and add 240. This is the same as 0+120+120. Since the base color in this palette is the pure red in `RGB`, you might have noticed that this triadic palette yields the `RGB` primary colors.
6. Follow the same procedure for the green row. For this one, you can add 120 and 240 to the 2 copies.
7. For the blue row, you'll need to subtract 120 to one copy, and add 120 to the other to keep the hues in the 0-360 range. Notice the similarities to the first row that uses pure red, green, and blue? This row's base color is only 50% as saturated, which yields a similar, but more subdued palette.
8. Do the same procedure for the fourth row, adding or subtracting 120° as necessary.

In the next exercise, you're going to get more complex and build a 4 color tetradic harmony.
