* Refers to the relative proportions of 2 areas of color. For balance, different colors require less (e.g. a splash of warm yellow is enough to balance a large field of cool blue).
* Harmonious proportions, according to Itten:
  * Yellow:violet = 1:3
  * Orange:blue = 1:2
  * Red:green = 1:1
* Incredibly arbitrary!!


The contrast of extent is also known as the contrast of proportion. It refers to the *amount* of color present in a composition, and how dominant that color is in relation to other colors. As you have no doubt realized at this point, some colors are more vibrant than others, so you can use less of the color to capture attention.

### Uneven Palettes

Though we didn't discuss this in the lessons on color harmony, a harmonious color palette rarely uses equal mixtures of each color. One or two colors are usually allowed to dominate to bring balance to the composition, and high contrast hues are usually used in small doses to avoid overwhelming the design (unless that is specifically the goal).

### Systems

Munsell + Itten came up with a thing.

## Exercises

1. Open up the design document with all 7 contrast frames that you started in the [contrast overview lesson]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _color/070-contrast-overview.md %}).
2. Zoom into the "extension-contrast" frame.
3. Draw 3 stacked rectangles, each one 800x200 high with no space between them.
4. Give the top rectangle a fill of `#FF0000`, the middle rectangle a fill of `#FF00FF`, and the bottom rectangle a fill of `#0000FF`.
5. Duplicate the red rectangle, and reduce the duplicate's width by half so that it is now 400x200. Give this duplicate a fill of `#00FFFF`. The top row should now be half cyan, half red.
6. Next, duplicate the magenta rectangle in the middle row. Reduce the duplicate's width to <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> of its width, or about 266x200. Give the duplicate a fill color of `#00FF00`.
7. In the final row, create a duplicate of the blue rectangle and reduce its width to <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>, or 200x200. Give the new rectangle a fill color of `#FFFF00`.
8. These proportions roughly conform to those mentioned by Itten, but don't overthink the proportions. They are loose guidelines that you can use to make it easier to balance the color in a given composition.

Keep in mind that these proportions are mostly arbitrary. They can and should be broken when there's a need to do so. In the next and final lesson on contrasts, you're going to learn about simultaneous contrast.
