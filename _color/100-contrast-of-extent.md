The contrast of extent is also known as the contrast of proportion. It refers to the *amount* of color present in a composition, and how dominant that color is in relation to other colors. As you have no doubt realized at this point, some colors are more vibrant than others, so you can use less of the color to capture attention.

### Uneven Palettes

A harmonious color palette rarely uses equal mixtures of each color. One or two colors are usually allowed to dominate to bring balance to the composition, and high contrast hues are usually used in smaller doses to avoid overwhelming the design (unless that is specifically the goal).

### Itten's Proportions

Itten has provided us with a set of proportional guidelines *when our goal is balanced color*. Many believe these to be quite arbitrary, but are still useful rules of thumb to keep in mind. The main idea is that you need less of a warm color to balance a cool color. These have been modified from Itten's original contrast of extents for digital color.

* Red and Cyan should be used **1:1**, as they have roughly equal vibrancy.
* Green and Magenta should be used **2:1**, as magenta is warmer and more vibrant than green.
* Blue and Yellow should be used **3:1**, as yellow is far more vibrant than blue.

## Exercises

1. Open up the design document with all 7 contrast frames that you started in the [contrast overview lesson]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _color/070-contrast-overview.md %}).
2. Zoom into the "extension-contrast" frame.
3. Draw 3 stacked rectangles, each one 800x200 high with no space between them.
4. Give the top rectangle a fill of `#FF0000`, the middle rectangle a fill of `#FF00FF`, and the bottom rectangle a fill of `#0000FF`.
5. Duplicate the red rectangle, and reduce the duplicate's width by half so that it is now 400x200. Give this duplicate a fill of `#00FFFF`. The top row should now be half cyan, half red.
6. Next, duplicate the magenta rectangle in the middle row. Reduce the duplicate's width to <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> of its width, or about 266x200. Give the duplicate a fill color of `#00FF00`.
7. In the final row, create a duplicate of the blue rectangle and reduce its width to <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>, or 200x200. Give the new rectangle a fill color of `#FFFF00`.
8. These proportions roughly conform to those mentioned by Itten, but don't overthink the proportions. They are loose guidelines that you can use to make it easier to balance the color in a given composition.

Keep in mind these rules can and should be broken when there's a need to do so. In the next and final lesson on contrasts, you're going to learn about simultaneous contrast. Keep this design file.
