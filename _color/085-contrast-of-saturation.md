* Difference between a "pure" color, and one that has been diluted or dulled.
* Desaturation communicates distance, saturation communicates closeness
* Fully saturated and desaturated are not often perceived in the natural world.
* Dark shadows are usually saturated with the color of the surface the shadow is projected onto, since light rays bounce back onto the object
* Saturation, chroma, etc.

## Exercises

1. Open up the design document with all 7 contrast frames that you started in the [contrast overview lesson]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _color/070-contrast-overview.md %}).
2. Zoom into the "saturation-contrast" frame.
3. Draw a rectangle in the left half of the frame that is 400x600, and give it the fill color `#C0C0C0`.
4. Draw 2 80x80 circles in that gray rectangle, stacked vertically and evenly spaced out. Exactness doesn't matter much, but try to leave about 150px of space between the two circles.
5. Give the top circle a blue hue of 240°, saturation of 60%, and brightness of 100%.
6. Give the bottom circle the same hue of 240°, saturation of 100%, and brightness 100%. The bottom circle should appear to be a rich, pure blue.
7. The only difference between the two circles is saturation, but after looking at them for a few seconds, notice how the bottom circle appears to "come forward," almost seeming closer to you than the top? This illustrates the idea that saturated color is associated with nearness in nature, since objects farther away are viewed through an atmosphere that seems to dilute the color.
8. In the right half of this frame, draw another 400x600 rectangle or duplicate the one on the left. Give this one the same fill color as the top circle in the left half of the frame, or hex value `#6666FF`.
9. Inside the blue rectangle draw 2 smaller 160x80 rectangles. Arrange them like you arranged the circles: vertically stacked, with about 150px of space between them.
10. Give the top rectangle the fill color of `#9999FF`, and the bottom the color of `#3333FF`.
11. Something interesting is happening with this frame. The light and dark rectangles seemingly have the opposite effect of the circles on the left. This time, the darker rectangle appears to be "behind," and the lighter rectangle seems to sit on top of the background. Since the two rectangles and background all share the same hue and brightness, which is important. Shadows tend to be more saturated, and highlights tend to be less saturated in the natural world. This creates the effect that the darker rectangle is the same color as the background, but *indented*, whereas the opposite happens for the lighter rectangle. You didn't need to adjust the brightness at all to achieve a rich shadow tone, which is important to remember. In UI design, the perception of depth helps convey meaning and function, and saturation is a way of achieving it without resorting to making everything dark.

In the next lesson, you're going to look at the contrast of light and dark.
