* Difference between a "pure" color, and one that has been diluted or dulled.
* Desaturation communicates distance, saturation communicates closeness
* Fully saturated and desaturated are not often perceived in the natural world.
* Dark shadows are usually saturated with the color of the surface the shadow is projected onto, since light rays bounce back onto the object
