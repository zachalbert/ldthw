Hexadic color palettes are very similar to [square palettes]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _color/060-color-harmonies-square.md %}), but they use 6 equally spaced colors rather than 4.

Hexadic harmonies create very balanced, colorful palettes. When used in sequence, they provide an almost analogous effect since they step all the way around the color wheel.

### Beware Extents

Hexadic harmonies are also challenging to use, simply because of the large number of colors to work with. By mixing both warm and cool colors in the same palette, balancing them all can be tough. For instance, yellow is a more vibrant color, and requires less of it to balance against its complement of blue. You will learn more about this in the lesson on the [contrast of extents]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _color/100-contrast-of-extent.md %}).

## Exercises

1. Open up the design document with all 7 color harmony frames that you started in the [color harmonies lesson]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _color/035-color-harmonies-overview.md %}).
2. Zoom into the "hexadic" frame.
3. Hexadic color palettes are very broad, using 6 colors evenly spaced by 2 steps on the color wheel, or 60°.
4. Select the red circle in the first row, and create 5 copies. Add an additional 60° to each copy, resulting in final hue values of 0, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300.
5. Repeat the procedure for the green circle in the second row. The last color will require you to "loop around". One easy way to do this math is to subtract 360. Here's what that would look like typed in: 91+60+60+60+60+60-360. That could get confusing though, so you could simply subtract 60 from the base hue to get the color for the last circle. In either case you'll end up with a value of 31.
6. Follow the same procedure for the blue row, and the row with the color you chose.

### A Final Note

You have now learned about all of the color harmonies. Remember that these harmonies are mere guidelines, and your numbers don't always have to be perfect. They can vary by <sup>+</sup>/<sub>-</sub> 15° while still maintaining the harmony you're shooting for.

The final takeaway is to not worry too much about the academic definitions of color harmonies. Like all things in design, the thing you design has to pass the final aesthetic test of whether it looks good or not. If you've come up with the most clever color harmony that looks bad, then it's ultimately unsuccessful. On the other hand, if you break all the rules and come up with something aesthetically pleasing, then you were successful.

Hang on to this design document. In the next series of lessons, you're going to deepen your understanding of color theory by learning about the 7 color contrasts.
