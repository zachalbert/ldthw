## Exercises

1. Open up the design document with all 7 color harmony frames that you started in the [color harmonies lesson]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _color/035-color-harmonies-overview.md %}).
2. Zoom into the "hexadic" frame.
3. Hexadic color palettes are very broad, using 6 colors evenly spaced by 2 steps on the color wheel, or 60°.
4. Select the red circle in the first row, and create 5 copies. Add an additional 60° to each copy, resulting in final hue values of 0, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300.
5. Repeat the procedure for the green circle in the second row. The last color will require you to "loop around". One easy way to do this math is to subtract 360. Here's what that would look like typed in: 91+60+60+60+60+60-360. That could get confusing though, so you could simply subtract 60 from the base hue to get the color for the last circle. In either case you'll end up with a value of 31.
6. Follow the same procedure for the blue row, and the row with the color you chose.

You have now learned all about color harmonies, which provide guidelines on how to pair different hues together.

Keep in mind that the numbers don't have to always be perfect; they can vary by <sup>+</sup>/<sub>-</sub> 15°. For instance, the complement of pure red is cyan, at 180°. But 194° could also be considered a complement of red. Once it's closer to 210° than 180° though, it then becomes more of a split complement.

The final takeaway is to not worry too much about the academic definitions of color harmonies. Like all things in design, what you produce has to pass the final aesthetic test. If you've come up with the most clever color harmony that does't look good, then it's ultimately unsuccessful. On the other hand, if you break all the rules and come up with something aesthetically pleasing, then you were successful.

Hang on to this design document. In the next series of lessons, you're going to deepen your understanding of color theory by learning about the 7 contrasts.
