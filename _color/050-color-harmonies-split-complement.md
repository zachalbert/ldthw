Split complementary palettes are a slight variation on [complementary harmony]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _color/040-color-harmonies-complementary.md %}). These palettes can be very energetic, or calm and balanced with the right proportions.

A split complementary palette uses 3 colors. It looks a bit like a complementary pair, but one of the pairs is split to use the color on either side. The relationship between the two colors closest to each other is close to analogous, and therefore fairly subdued. However, they are paired with a high-contrast complement.

### Using Split Complements
Proportions are very important when working with split complements. Typically, you will let two colors dominate, while using the other as an accent.

For instance, if you allow the two closest colors to dominate, then use their complement on the other side of the wheel as an accent, you will achieve a calming palette with vibrant splashes of color. You will see this combination used frequently in interior design.

## Exercises

1. Open up the design document with all 7 color harmony frames that you started in the [color harmonies lesson]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _color/035-color-harmonies-overview.md %}).
2. Zoom into the "split complementary" frame.
3. Select the red circle, and make 2 copies to the right.
4. For the two copies, you want to pick both colors that live on either side of the base color's complement. Start by selecting the second red circle, and open its fill color options dialog.
5. In the hue field, first add 180 to get the complement of red. Then, add another 30 to get the color one step away from the complement. You could go straight to adding 210 to the hue field, but I prefer to type out the equation fully to make sure I don't make mistakes: "0+180+30".
6. In the third red circle, add 180 to the hue value to get the complement. This time however, *subtract* 30 from red's complement to get the color a step away on the other side. The hue values you should end up with for the 2 split complements of pure red are 150, and 210.
7. Now follow the same procedure for the green row. Make 2 copies, and add 150 to the second and 210 to the third.
8. For the third row of blue, after making 2 copies, you'll need to invert your math and subtract 150 and 210 degrees, respectively. This will prevent hues greater than 360 which Figma doesn't allow.
9. Finally, in the last row, try to get the 2 split complements on your own. Remember to add or subtract 150 and 210 based on your starting hue value to prevent the final number going above 360 or below 0.

In the next lesson, you're going to tackle triadic harmonies. Keep this file handy.
