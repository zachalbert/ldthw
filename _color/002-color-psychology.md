Color psychology, as it's commonly described, is the belief that the presence of certain colors in our environment will affect our behavior. While reliable evidence does exist that color has an effect, it's a subtle one that is specific to an individual.

As it relates to brands, the [Gestalt Law of Past Experience]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _gestalt/050-gestalt-law-past-experience.md %}) gives us a clue about how color psychology works. This law says that we tend to group our perceptions with similar things we've experienced in the past.

This gives us a sense of expectation about new experiences, so that we only tend to notice brands that break patterns. Using neon pink and yellow for a bank would look odd to most people, but nobody would notice if that same pink & yellow combo was used for a snow cone shack.

Popular descriptions of color psychology fall apart when they claim that specific colors have the ability to evoke a specific emotion in a person. Statements such as “red equals passion” or “blue means stability” *may* evoke emotions, but those emotions will be subtle, and different for each person depending on their preferences, cultural background, religion, social mores, and a host of other factors.

### Primary Takeaway

Rather than thinking about color psychology as a form of mind control, think of it as a way of calling to mind past experiences. Pay special attention to the way brands express themselves through color. Understanding those patterns will allow you to use them intelligently.

## Exercises

1. Write down 5 popular luxury brands, and 5 popular kid / youth oriented brands. Copy and paste logos and other brand materials into a design document so that you can easily see the colors most commonly used by each brand.
2. In your document, draw 3 color squares for each brand. For the fill color, <span data-keyCombo="color-picker">sample</span> the 3 most common colors you see used for each brand. You should end up with 30 color squares: 15 color squares for luxury brands, and 15 for youth brands.
3. Analyze the patterns you see. Which brands conform to a mold? Which break it?
4. Finally, create a 3-color palette for a fake brand that conforms to the patterns you see. Create one palette for a fake luxury brand, and one for youth brand. You can use the <span data-keyCombo="color-picker">color picker</span> to quickly sample colors that you like, or you can create them yourself from scratch. The result should be two color palettes that feel like they belong with the brands you chose.

You can use this technique to quickly pick the colors for a new brand that "fit" a category, or the reverse of this technique if your goal is to stand apart from the norm.
