Like [tetradic harmonies]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _color/057-color-harmonies-tetradic.md %}), a square harmony consists of 4 colors. However, in a square palette, all 4 colors are equally spaced around the color wheel by 90째.

The square color harmony is very colorful, and provides the greatest amount of hue contrast possible with 4 colors. This is useful when you need to design something energetic but need more color choices than either [complementary]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _color/040-color-harmonies-complementary.md %}) or [triadic]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _color/055-color-harmonies-triadic.md %}) palettes will allow.

## Exercises

1. Open up the design document with all 7 color harmony frames that you started in the [color harmonies lesson]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _color/035-color-harmonies-overview.md %}).
2. Zoom into the "square" frame.
4. Start with the first red row, and create 3 copies.
5. Add an additional 90째 to each of the copies, resulting in the 4 hue values of 0, 90, 180, and 270.
6. For the second row of green, do the same. However, watch out for that last color, which will just barely go past 360. The final hues should be: 91, 181, 271, and 1 respectively.
7. Follow the same procedure for the blue row. Make sure to keep all the colors 90째 apart, and in the 0-360째 range, which will require you to both add and subtract.
8. Finally, repeat the procedure for the fourth row of color.

In the next lesson, you're going to learn about the final color harmony: hexadic. You'll continue to use the same design file.
