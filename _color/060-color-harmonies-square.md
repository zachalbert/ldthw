![Square Color Harmony](/images/color/color-wheel-square.png)

* A square harmony is very similar to the tetradic harmony. Both use 4 colors, but the square harmony uses 2 pairs of complements that are perpendicular to each other. This results in 4 colors that are perfectly spaced around the color wheel, with 2 steps between each part of the palette.

## Exercises

1. Open up the design document with all 7 color harmony frames that you started in the [color harmonies lesson]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _color/035-color-harmonies-overview.md %}).
2. Zoom into the "square" frame.
4. Start with the first red row, and create 3 copies.
5. Add an additional 90° to each of the copies, resulting in the 4 hue values of 0, 90, 180, and 270.
6. For the second row of green, do the same. However, watch out for that last color, which will just barely go past 360. The final hues should be: 91, 181, 271, and 1 respectively.
7. Follow the same procedure for the blue row. Make sure to keep all the colors 90° apart, and in the 0-360° range, which will require you to both add and subtract.
8. Finally, repeat the procedure for the fourth row of color.

In the next lesson, you're going to learn about the final color harmony: hexadic. You'll continue to use the same design file.
