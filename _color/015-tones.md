In the [last exercise]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _color/010-shades.md %}), you created 4 shaded variations of a base color.

In this exercise, you're going to create 4 tonal variations. Tones are created when gray is added to a color, or put another way, when the color is desaturated.

In nature, objects that recede in the distance become more desaturated. If you're in a jungle up close, the colors are overwhelmingly bright and saturated. However, if you look at a jungle from a great distance, like looking at a distant mountain range, the colors will be a more uniform gray.

Tonal variations are a great way to achieve a more subtle, natural effect. When mixed with white, tones take on a quality commonly referred to as "pastel."

In this exercise you're going to follow the same process as in the previous two.

## Exercise

1. In the same design document you created in the last exercise, create a copy of your base circle directly underneath the other two. Double check that the fill color is `#407A80`.
2. Now create 4 copies to the right, for a total of 5 circle.
3. In the second circle from the left, reduce the saturation by 10.
4. Do the same for the other 3, decreasing the saturation by an additional 10 each time.

You now have a document with 4 tints, 4 shades, and 4 tones all from a single base color. You will use this technique when exploring color palettes later.
