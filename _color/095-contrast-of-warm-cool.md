* Cool:
  * Green/blue - blue/violet
  * Communicates distance, airiness, shadow, slow, sedative, coldness
  * Recedes in depth, appearing "behind"
* Warm:
  * Red/violet - Green/yellow
  * Communicates nearness, warmth, energy, sunlight
  * Comes forward in depth, appearing in front

## Exercises

1. Open up the design document with all 7 contrast frames that you started in the [contrast overview lesson]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _color/070-contrast-overview.md %}).
2. Zoom into the "warm-cool-contrast" frame.
3. Draw a 400x300 rectangle in the upper left with a light neutral gray fill of `#D9D9D9`.
4. Draw an 80x80 circle, and align it vertically and horizontally within the gray rectangle. Give it the fill color `#FF4000`.
5. Select both of these shapes, then create 3 duplicates that are positioned in the upper right, bottom left, and bottom right quadrants of the frame.
6. Keep the neutral gray the same for all 4 background rectangles. Change the fill color of the circle in the upper right to `#00BFFF`, which is the complement of the red-orange circle to the left.
7. For the circle in the bottom left, give it the fill color `#FF8000`. Give the bottom right circle the fill color `#0080FF`, which is the complement of the orange circle to the left.
8. Now that your frame is set up, look at the 4 circles. The red and orange circles are from the warm side of the color wheel, and the blues are from cool side. If you look left to right, do you notice how the warmer circles appear to advance forward, and the blues recede? Warm/cool contrast is another powerful tool to help you arrange the perceptual hierarchy — allowing you to pull important design elements forward in a viewer's attention, and push less important things further back.

This is a very simple demonstration of warm/cool contrast. While it is very useful for adjusting the perceptual hierarchy, you can also use warmer colors to give a design a more comforting, human feeling. Cooler colors can be used to give a design a colder, more analytical feel.

In the next lesson, you're going to be learn about the contrast of extension.
