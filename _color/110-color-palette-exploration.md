In this final lesson on color, you're going to learn a repeatable process for designing color palettes. The process of designing a color palette from scratch is exploratory. You will need to look at many different color combinations to arrive at something that is pleasing. You will learn some rough guidelines for doing this, but like everything you have learned so far, the key to mastery is **practice**.

### Seeing is Believing

When working with color, seeing is believing. It's important to have the discipline to create many color options to know what will work and what will not. You know by now that color perception is a complex series of processes with many hidden effects, so it's not enough to simply imagine what colors might look good together.

You have to actually *create* color options, then *look* at them. This might seem painfully obvious, but it's worth mentioning. Try to avoid uttering the phrase "that won't look good" when imagining what color combinations you might try.

### Start With Goals & Inspiration

It's important to start your color palette explorations with clear goals, paired with your inspiration that embodies those goals. You [began collecting inspiration]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _color/001-color-overview.md %}) in the very first lesson on color, and now is the time to use it.

Define your goals as specifically as you can, and if your inspiration library doesn't have anything that embodies those goals, then go collecting.

When you have a handful of pieces that inspire you, copy and paste these images into the design file you're going to be using. This will make it easy to keep the inspiration top of mind.

### Innovate Down, Iterate Right

The exercise will follow a suggested process that I have used to explore color palettes. This isn't strictly necessary to follow, but will allow you to keep a rough sort of organization to your design file. If you're doing it right, your color palette exploration file will quickly turn into an absolute cacophony of color combinations, and you may have a difficult time understanding what you did later.

The basic idea is that you will create *unique and different* color combinations by moving down in your design file, and create *variations* on schemes you like by moving to the right. Not only will this keep you somewhat organized, it also gives you a process to follow.

## Exercises
When exploring color palettes, don't worry about working on a frame. The medium gray background is actually recommended to reduce the influence of the surrounding color.

This exercise will walk you through the process of creating a color palette. This is an inherently messy, exploratory process so there is no accompanying video. You can refer back to this exercise every time you do this until you have learned what works for you.

1. Start with a new design document.
2. First, define your goals. These might be [principles you've developed]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _basics/020-developing-principles.md %}), themes, or example photos you're starting with. Write these goals down in the design document.
3. Next, gather visual inspiration and paste it in the design document next to your goals. This may come from your personal inspiration library, or be collected online, from photographs, or printed materials. You may also want to use color palette inspiration sites like [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/explore/) or [Colour Lovers](http://www.colourlovers.com/palettes). Refer back to your inspiration when you get stuck.
4. Now, create a 100x100 circle or square to serve as a color swatch. Give it a medium neutral gray color.
5. Start exploring options by "innovating down". Create duplicate copies beneath the first swatch, giving each one a unique color. You should end up with a column of unique colors.
6. Next, pick one of these swatches and "iterate right". Create variations of that color by adjusting hue, saturation, and brightness. Create a tones, tints, and shades. Do this for several of your favorite swatches.
7. As you start narrowing down your favorite colors, begin to add supporting colors to create pleasing color harmonies.
8. You may need to "start over" several times. If your table of color exploration becomes overwhelming, pick a few of your favorite combinations and move to a blank spot in your document. Again, repeat the process of innovating down, iterating right. The more you do this, the more complex your color palettes will become.
9. When you have created many options to choose from (if you don't have at least 50-100 variations, you're not trying hard enough), start to create small [style tiles]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _basics/050-style-tiles.md %}) to test your favorite color combinations. Experiment with letting one color be dominant, then duplicate the style tile and let a different color take precedence.
10. The final test is to apply your color palette to something real. It's not enough to create a color palette completely in a vacuum. You'll never know if it's perfect until you actually design with it, so don't worry about making it perfect at this stage. As you start to apply it in real design work, don't hesitate to continue to tweak the colors until they achieve the effect you're looking for.

This concludes the final lesson on designing with color. Remember that mastering color takes lots of practice, so go easy on yourself. Observe, analyze, and practice working with color daily to solidify and grow your color skills. While it is difficult, it's an incredibly rewarding skill that will help your design work truly stand out.
