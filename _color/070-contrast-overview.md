In the next several lessons, you're going to be learning about the 7 contrasts, as described by influential color theorist Johannes Itten. Itten contributed a great deal to the field of color theory, and while he wrote prior to the age of digital design, there is much we can learn from his work [The Art of Color](LINKME AFFILIATE).

### Contrast, Contrast, Contrast

Contrast is one of the most important things you have at your disposal as a designer. Humans are conditioned to notice things that stand apart from their surroundings. This can be visual contrast, but also cultural or conceptual contrast. Graphic designers and fine artists routinely play with what a viewer expects to see, in order to redirect attention or provoke thought.

### The 7 contrasts

In this lesson, we're specifically going to talk about the types of contrast you can achieve with the components of color. By the end of this next series, you will have learned about the following.

1. The contrast of **complements**
2. The contrast of **hue**
3. The contrast of **saturation**
4. The contrast of **light / dark**
5. The contrast of **warm / cool**
6. The contrast of **extent**
7. The contrast of **simultaneity**

The following exercise will set up your design document for the next seven lessons.
