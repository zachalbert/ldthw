Complementary colors are the first color harmony you're going to learn about. This harmony consists of two colors, which are opposite from each other on the color wheel.

Narrowly defined, two complements will yield a perfectly neutral gray tone when mixed together. This effect will be demonstrated in the upcoming lesson [contrast of complements]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _color/075-contrast-of-complements.md %}). Essentially, complementary colors cancel each other out.

When two complements are placed *next* to each other (rather than mixed together), the result is the greatest amount of contrast possible between those two colors. This is why complementary colors are referred to as color opposites.

### CONTRAST!!

Because of the great amount of contrast between complementary color pairs, these palettes are often used when the design needs to shout. You'll see complementary palettes used frequently in sports brands, such as the logo of your local team or an energy drink for athletes.

### Complements in RGB

Remember that when working with digital color, use the `RGB` color wheel rather than the traditional `RYB` wheel, as they will yield different complementary pairs. Refer to [the lesson on `RGB` vs `RYB`]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _color/030-color-models-rgb-vs-ryb.md %})for a refresher.

### Use With Caution

Complementary palettes should be used with caution, and only when the design requires a great deal of energy.

Another use for complementary pairs is when you really need to grab a user's attention, as in the case of a call to action button on a website. You want to make sure calls to action don't blend in with their background, and the easiest way to do that is to pick the direct color opposite of the background your button sits on.

## Exercises
In this lesson, you're going to learn to derive complementary color pairs from a variety of different base colors.

1. Open up the design document you worked on in the [last lesson]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _color/035-color-harmonies-overview.md %}).
2. Zoom in to look at the "complementary" frame. A quick way to do this is to select the frame and use the <span data-keyCombo="zoom-to-fit">Zoom to Fit</span> function.
3. Select the red circle. Create a copy on the right side of the circle.
4. Change the fill color of the second circle to the complement of red. You can simply sample the color from the opposite side of the color wheel that you just created. Double check the fill color of the new color in HSB mode. The hue should be 180, which is half of a 360° circle, and the farthest away from 360° that you can get.
5. There, you did it! The red / cyan combination represents a complementary color palette. You are going to follow the same procedure for the other colors now.
6. Select the green, and create a copy on the right. This time, the green is not a pure green, so you'll need to be more clever about how you figure out its complement. Open the fill color options for the second green circle you created, and add 180 to the hue. You can either do this the old-fashioned way (with a calculator!), or you can use the built-in calculator. In the hue field, after "91", type "+180" and hit `return`. Figma should do the math for you, resulting in a hue of 271.
7. Next, select the blue and create a copy. While you can follow a similar procedure, this time you'll need to *subtract* 180 from the hue. If you added 180, that would result in a number greater than 360°, which would get capped by Figma at 360.
8. Finally, follow the same procedure for the fourth color you picked. If the hue value of your color is less than 180, then you should add 180. If it's greater than 180, then you should subtract.

Complementary color palettes are pretty easy to put together. You're going to follow a similar procedure to arrive at other, more complex harmonies in the next lessons.
