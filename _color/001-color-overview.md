* Why color is important
* Why color is hard. Colors affect and are affected by their surroundings.
* How to get better. How to develop your eye.
* Different ways of picking color. #hex is useful for any RGB based color, because it's easy to copy/paste.

### Developing Your Eye
In this exercise, you're going to start the process of developing your eye for color. This is a very personal, subjective exercise. Subjectivity is the nature of color. People experience color in unique and unexpected ways, so it's important that you balance the study of color theory, with structured observation and practice. When your eye is fully developed, you'll be able to quickly identify which color combinations are successful, which are not, and what you need to do to make them more successful.

## Exercise
1. Create a new pinterest board for color inspiration (or a similar tool of your choice).
2. Set a timer for 15 minutes.
3. Surf your favorite inspiration sites. They don't have to be design specific (e.g. [dribbble](https://www.dribbble.com) or [behance](https://www.behance.net/)). Look at architecture, furniture and fashion design, or color photography from nature.
4. Save anything that strikes you to your color inspiration board until the timer is up.
5. When the 15 minutes have passed, go through your board and add tags to describe the color combinations you see. Use emotive words like "bold," "calming," or "warm." In the next series of lessons, you're going to learn a lot about color theory, which will allow you to use more descriptive tags and categories. For now, simply tag your inspiration with the best descriptive words you can.

Going through this exercise *once* won't teach you much. Mastery over color is measured not in minutes, but years. This exercise is intended to be a **daily** discipline. Over time, you will develop a sense of mastery over color that will allow you to evoke specific feelings at will. Keep this board handy, and add to it and tag color combinations that you like.
