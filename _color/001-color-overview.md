Developing your skill in working with color is one of the most challenging, but rewarding aspects of design. It can make a boring design captivating, it can communicate and sway emotions, and can do all those things in a split second. The mastery of color is measured not in days or weeks, but in years.

### Buckle Up

One of the reasons color is difficult is that it is a system of abstraction. "Red" or "Blue" are just abstract concepts. The words point to a group of possible experiences with certain wavelengths of light. It's easy to say "Red," but difficult to know what another person means with precision.

Color is difficult because it's inherently subjective. Historically, color theory is riddled with misconceptions, dogma, science and pseudoscience, which makes it difficult to pin down observable rules about why one color expression is more aesthetically pleasing than another. Aesthetics change by culture, geography, and time period.

Color also has a relative quality to it — the character of a specific color will change depending on the colors that surround it, the amount and quality of the light, and the fatigue in the viewer's eyes. This complexity involves the physics of light and the structure of the human eye and brain — which we are still in the process of understanding fully.

### What You Will Learn

Despite the complexity of learning color, you will walk away from this section with enough knowledge to march bravely into your own color explorations.

You will not get better at color in a day, or a week. But I encourage you to learn these fundamentals, maintain your open-minded spirit of adventure, and practice with discipline.

You will learn some fundamentals about working with color in design applications, how to create your own color palette explorations, and to make use of theoretical frameworks like color harmonies and color contrasts. You will also begin the process of developing your eye for color, a necessary step for furthering your color practice.

### Arbitrariness Disclaimer

Humans are capable of perceiving pleasing color without any training. Even from birth, humans develop preferences for particular wavelengths of light. Because of this observable fact, color theory represents an attempt to reverse engineer what makes a particular color or combination of colors aesthetically pleasing, both to explain and hopefully replicate pleasing effects. Modern color theories are rooted in the writings of artists, scientists and philosophers like Leonardo DaVinci, Isaac Newton, and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe stretching as far back as the 15th century – though humans have been working with color since the dawn of civilization.

Though modern color theory is rooted in study, experiment, and observation, it should never be a prison. The final metric to judge your command of color theory is your ability to faithfully produce aesthetically pleasing color combinations.

As you go through these exercises, trust your own perceptions of what you find pleasing. You are the authority on your personal aesthetic, which will develop over time the more you practice.

At the same time, develop your sense for what your target audience finds aesthetically pleasing. When doing design, **the aesthetic values of your audience should take priority over your own.**

## Exercise
This exercise gives you a process to develop your eye for color. This exercise is intended to be a **daily** discipline. Over time, you will develop a sense of mastery over color that will allow you to evoke specific feelings at will. Keep this board handy, and add to it and tag color combinations that you like.

1. Pick a bookmarking service, like dropmark or pinterest. Create a new board for color inspiration.
2. Set a timer for 15 minutes.
3. Surf your favorite inspiration sites. They don't have to be design specific (e.g. [Dribbble](https://www.dribbble.com) or [Behance](https://www.behance.net/)). Look at architecture, furniture and fashion design, or color photography from nature. Also consider installing a browser extension that delivers inspiration every day like [Muz.li](https://muz.li/) or [Panda](http://usepanda.com/).
4. Save anything that strikes you to your color inspiration board until the timer is up.
5. When the 15 minutes have passed, go through your board and add tags or descriptions to describe the color combinations you see. Use emotive words like "bold," "calming," or "warm." In the next series of lessons, you're going to learn a lot about color theory, which will allow you to use more descriptive tags and categories. For now, simply tag your inspiration with the best descriptive words you can. The purpose of adding this meta information is both to help you understand *why* you find something pleasing, but also to make it easily searchable when your inspiration library grows unruly.

That's it! Going through this exercise *once* won't teach you much. This is a simple exercise, but the hard part is continuing the discipline on a daily basis. Set reminders for yourself until it becomes a habit that you are able to sustain.
