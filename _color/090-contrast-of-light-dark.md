* Black & White are on both ends of the light / dark neutral spectrum
* For colors, show desaturated + bright white, saturated + dark violet
* light looks bigger

The contrast of light and dark is one of the most obvious contrasts you can work with. It deals with the difference between bright and dark versions of colors, including neutral tones.

One of the easiest ways to increase contrast is to increase the difference in brightness between colors in your palette.

### Light Advances

There is an interesting scientific principle at work when you mix lights and darks, in addition to the contrast you'll achieve. When placed next to each other, lighter colors tend to "advance" into dark areas. This can make a white dot on a black background appear larger than the same sized black dot on a white background.

When working with lots of text, it's advisable to use dark text on a light background, as opposed to white text on a dark background. The white background makes it easier to see black letterforms as crisp, whereas they can tend to become blurry or bleed when used on black backgrounds.

This is a slight effect though, and there are certainly times when light text on a dark background makes sense for your brand.

## Exercises

1. Open up the design document with all 7 contrast frames that you started in the [contrast overview lesson]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _color/070-contrast-overview.md %}).
2. Zoom into the "light-dark-contrast" frame.
3. In the upper left, draw a 400x300 rectangle with the fill color `#CCCCCC`.
4. In the horizontal and vertical center of that rectangle, draw a 40x40 circle with the fill color `#333333`.
5. Next, select both the rectangle and circle and duplicate them directly downward, situating them in the lower left of the frame.
6. With the duplicated shapes, swap the colors so the background rectangle uses the fill `#333333` and the circle on top of it uses fill `#CCCCCC`.
7. Now select all the shapes in this frame, and duplicate to the right. This should fill up the right side of the frame.
8. Give the upper right rectangle a fill of `#0000B2`, and the upper right circle a fill of `#0000FF`.
9. Swap the colors for the lower right shapes, so the rectangle uses `#0000FF` and the circle uses `#0000B2`.
10. What do you notice about the circles in the left column? Consciously, you can know they're the same size, but the lighter circle appears larger than the dark. When perceiving light objects, a subtle distortion takes place where the light seems to "advance" into the dark area, making it appear larger. This effect was first observed by Galileo when he noticed that brighter Venus appeared larger than Jupiter when viewed with the naked eye, even though he knew Jupiter is larger.
11. Notice the same effect with the blue circles? The lighter circle appears larger. Now look left to right and compare the blue circles to the neutral circles, then look at all 4 together. Which one stands out the most? The light circle in the lower left has the greatest amount of light/dark contrast with its background, so it appears to be the largest, and most active in this composition.

Light/dark contrast is a useful tool to move objects forward or backward in the perceptual hierarchy, especially if you pair it with saturation contrast. In the next lesson, you'll be learning about warm/cool contrast. Keep this design file.
