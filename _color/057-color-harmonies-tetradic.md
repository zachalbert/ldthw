## Exercises

1. Open up the design document with all 7 color harmony frames that you started in the [color harmonies lesson]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _color/035-color-harmonies-overview.md %}).
2. Zoom into the "tetradic" frame.
3. A tetradic palette uses 2 pairs of complements separated by a single step. Select the red circle, and make 3 copies to the right for 4 total.
4. In the second circle, simply get the complement of red. You should know how to do this by now. If not, refer to the lesson on [color complements]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _color/040-color-harmonies-complementary.md %}).
5. Next, select the third circle. Add 60° to the base color to get a color 2 steps away.
6. Select the fourth circle, and start by sampling the third circle's fill color. Then, add 180°. The first and second circles should be complements of each other, and the third and fourth should also be complements of each other.
7. For the second row of green, again start with 3 copies.
8. You can add 180 to the second, 60 to the third, and 240 to the fourth. However, you can also "flip" the rectangle by *subtracting* 60 from the third circle to get the color 2 steps away on the opposite of the base color. Again, the fourth should be a complement of the third. Both methods are equally valid tetradic harmonies.
9. For the row with blue, follow the same procedure. Choose whether you want the second pair of complements to start by adding or subtracting 60 from the base blue.
10. Finally, create a tetradic harmony with the color of your choice in the fourth row.

In the next row, you're going to learn about square harmonies, which are a slight variation of tetradic harmonies.
