Isaac Newton noticed something curious about paint color, that was later experimentally confirmed. When mixing paint, any given color has an "opposite" which, when mixed in the right proportions, produces a neutral gray tone. These pairs of colors were dubbed **complementary**. On the color wheel, complementary colors are directly opposite each other (separated by 180°), and match each other's saturation and brightness.

While complementary colors cancel each other out to produce neutrals when mixed, they also produce the greatest possible contrast when placed next to each other. As we've discussed already, colors can *change* based on the context in which they're viewed. You can make a yellow seem even more yellow by surrounding it with its complement, blue.

### Making It Useful

You can use complementary contrast to draw attention to certain areas of a design. This effect is commonly used to call attention to buttons or calls to action that need to really stand out.

Keep in mind that it doesn't take much of a complementary color to stand out. A small splash of a complementary color is often enough to really draw a user's attention without being overwhelming. At the same time, using large amounts of complementary colors can create a lot of aggressive energy in a design that might overwhelm. You'll frequently see design for sports teams using this effect.

## Exercises

1. Open up the design document with all 7 contrast frames that you started in the [last exercise]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _color/070-contrast-overview.md %}).
2. Zoom into the "complementary-contrast" frame.
3. Select the frame, and change its background color to a pure red: `#FF0000`.
4. Next, draw six 80x80 circles spaced evenly in a row in the center of the red frame.
5. Change the fill colors for each circle to the following.
  * Red: `#FF0000` (this red will blend in perfectly with the background)
  * Yellow: `#FFFF00`
  * Green: `#00FF00`
  * Cyan: `#00FFFF`
  * Blue: `#0000FF`
  * Magenta: `#FF00FF`
6. The six color circles are evenly spread around the color wheel (by 60°) to show you the contrast between the red background and other steps on the color wheel. Specifically, notice the edges between the foreground colors and the background. The more complementary the colors, the more you may notice a dark edge that seems to vibrate between the two colors.
7. Notice the difference between yellow and cyan where they meet the background red. While yellow is a naturally brilliant color, it seems to blend into the red background better than the cyan.
8. Now change the frame's background color to pure blue (you can just color sample the blue circle). Notice the complementary contrast happening with yellow? You'll probably also notice a high contrast effect with red and green, which sit on either side of yellow on the color wheel. The farther from the base hue a given hue is, the greater the contrast will be.

When finished, you should spend a few minutes changing the background color to a few other colors to produce complementary contrast between foreground and background elements. When you're ready to move on to the next lesson, hang on to this design file.

### Bonus

This isn't necessary to understand complementary contrast, but is a cool effect if you want to try it yourself. Somewhere on the side, create a checkerboard pattern with any complementary pair of colors. Start by drawing a 1x1 rectangle and making it red — you'll need to zoom in to see it easily. Use the key combination of `alt/option` dragging and <span data-keyCombo="duplicate">duplicating</span> to create many copies to quickly produce a ~40x40 checkerboard pattern. Create a copy of the red checkerboard, and nudge it 1 to the right, then give those copies a cyan fill color. Finally, slowly zoom out until the colors seem to become one. The final color should be a neutral gray, illustrating how 2 complementary colors always mix together to form a neutral gray.
