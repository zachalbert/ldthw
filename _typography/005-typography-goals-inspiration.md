Designing with type involves many tiny decisions. While it can take time to learn the nuance, you're going to learn a framework to walk you through the important decisions. This system is not meant to be restrictive, nor will it make you a master on its own, but will provide you with a foundation to expand your learning and typographic exploration.

### Designing Type Systems

The framework you will learn will result in a *typographic system*. This system will yield typography that is internally consistent and interdependent. By making a few base decisions, you'll be able to follow rules to arrive at other decisions. This will make setting type faster, less random, and begin to illuminate the internal beauty of well-set type.

### The Importance of Beginning With Goals

Typography is never random — or at least it shouldn't be. You should always begin any typographic exploration by creating a clear picture of your end goal, and find inspiration from other designers who have achieved similar goals successfully.

### The Law of Past Experience

While creating clear goals and finding good inspiration will help you make better decisions, that's not all it'll do.

By using the [Law of Past Experience]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _gestalt/050-gestalt-law-past-experience.md %}), you can take advantage of the success other designers have had. You will be more successful in communicating the character and style you are going for, even before you have mastered the ability to use typography effectively.

## Exercise
In the following series of exercises you're going to design a typographic system for a fictional travel website of your choosing. This first exercise will focus on building inspiration and forming a clear picture of the goal you're trying to achieve. You're going to be working in the same design file for the remainder of the lessons on typography, so keep your file well-organized.

1. Pick the niche you want your fictional travel website to occupy. In the accompanying videos, we're going
to design for a more luxurious travel website, but you can pick a different niche to challenge yourself.
2. In a new design document, paste several images of the type of travel this website will
cover. Also, paste images of other brands your readers will likely be accustomed to.
For our luxury travel website, I found inspiration from luxury clothing, condo, and car makers.
3. This inspiration will help you derive a few terms that represent your typographic goals. Refer to the exercise
on [developing brand principles]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _basics/020-developing-principles.md %})
for more information on how to do this.
4. The typographic terms I ended up with are **sharp**, **highly modulated**, **heavy**. While these terms don't have to refer specifically to typography, they conjure up a clear image in my mind — which is the most important part about picking these terms. Write these terms in your design file prominently so you can keep them in mind when designing.

Once you have your inspiration and abstract principles established, you're ready to move on. Keep this design file handy for the next lesson.
