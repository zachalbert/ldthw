## Exercise
In the following series of exercises you're going to design a typographic system for a fictional travel website of your choosing. This first exercise will focus on building inspiration and forming a clear picture of the goal you're trying to achieve. You're going to be working in the same design file for the remainder of the lessons on typography.

1. Pick the niche you want your fictional travel website to occupy. In the videos, we're going
to design for a more luxurious travel website, but you can pick a different niche to challenge yourself.
2. In a new design document, paste several images of the type of travel this website will
cover. Also, paste images of other brands your readers will likely be accustomed to.
For our luxury travel website, I found inspiration from luxury clothing, condo, and car makers.
3. This inspiration will help you derive a few terms that represent your typographic goals. Refer to the exercise
on [developing brand principles]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _basics/020-developing-principles.md %})
for more information on how to do this.
4. The typographic terms I ended up with are **sharp**, **highly modulated**, **heavy**. While these terms don't have to refer specifically to typography, they conjure up a clear image in my mind â€” which is the most important part about picking these terms. Write these terms in your design file prominently so you can keep them in mind when designing.

Once you have your inspiration and abstract principles established, you're ready to move on. Keep this design file handy for the next lesson.
