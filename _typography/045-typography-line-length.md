* What it is, why it's important to get the optimal line length (measure)
* Line length is important to control because it affects reading speed. If the line length is too short, text will be fast to read but increase eye fatigue. Line lengths that are too long will make it more challenging to find the next line of text, also increasing fatigue.
* Rule of thumb 65 - 85

## Exercise
In the [last exercise]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _typography/040-typography-consistent-line-height.md %}), you used a common number to determine internally consistent line heights for each level of your content hierarchy. In this lesson, you're going to establish the horizontal width of your text boxes.

1. This exercise will be faster. The rule of thumb for optimal line lengths (also known as *typographic measure*) is roughly between 65â€“85 characters. Start by selecting one of your longer paragraphs of text.
2. You can either manually count characters, or use an online tool like [Letter Count](https://www.lettercount.com/). Reduce the width of your paragraph text until there are roughly 65-85 characters on a single line.
3. You will learn more about using grids in the upcoming [lessons on layout grids]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _layout/005-layout-grids-overview.md %}), which can help you maintain control over line lengths across device widths. For now however, you will use simple rulers to keep your line lengths consistent across your text blocks.
4. Center the paragraph of text in the frame by going to the Arrange menu, then selecting "Align Horizontal Centers". It should snap to center of the frame.
5. Next, turn on your rulers by going to `View > Show Rulers`.
6. Move your mouse over the ruler on the left edge of the design area until the cursor changes to a double-sided arrow. Click and drag to create a vertical ruler, positioning it over the left edge of the paragraph until it snaps. Repeat the procedure to create a ruler on the right edge of the paragraph.
7. Position all the other text blocks using those same rulers. Move and resize them until you have a single column for all your text.

When finished, you now have a near-complete typographic system. The only thing left to do is work out the spacing between blocks of text which you'll tackle in the next lesson. Keep this file handy.
