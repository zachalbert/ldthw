You just changed all the line heights for your blocks of text, so in this exercise you're going to figure out how wide your text should be. This width is called line length, or measure.

## Why Measure Matters

If your lines of text are too long, it can seriously hamper readability and greatly increase fatigue. Short lines of text are really fast to read since the eye doesn't have to travel as far to find the next line, but the frantic pace still results in fatigue.

## Rule of Thumb: 65—85 Characters

Optimal line length is between 65—85 characters.

However, line height plays a factor in what you decide. If your line height is on the looser end of the spectrum, then you can get away with longer lines of text. If line height is tight, then you'll need to shorten your measure to compensate.

## Consistent & Strong Margins

Once you pick a line length for your body copy, then you'll make all other levels in your content hierarchy conform to the same width.

By making all your text blocks use the same width, you will establish a very strong left and right margin. You should use this margin to align other design elements, which makes it easier for your audience to scan down the left side to find what they are looking for. It also reinforces the feeling of stability you've worked so hard to achieve.

### Use Rulers

You will learn more about [layout grids]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _layout/005-layout-grids-overview.md %}) in future lessons which will make this easier, but a quick way to make your margins more visible is to use rulers. In Figma, you can toggle <span data-keyCombo="show-rulers">show rulers</span> from the view menu, then click and drag from anywhere on the ruler to create a red guideline. These guidelines are just for you — they won't appear in exports. You use a couple of ruler guides to make it easier to maintain the same width for all your text blocks.

## Exercise
In the [last exercise]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _typography/040-typography-consistent-line-height.md %}), you used a common number to determine internally consistent line heights for each level of your content hierarchy. In this lesson, you're going to establish the horizontal width of your text boxes.

1. This exercise will be quick. Start by selecting, then copying one line of text from one of your paragraphs of text.
2. The next step is to figure out how many characters are in that line. You can either manually count characters, or use an online tool like [Letter Count](https://www.lettercount.com/). Reduce the width of your paragraph text then recount until there are roughly 65-85 characters on a single line.
4. Center the paragraph of text in the frame by going to the Arrange menu, then selecting "Align Horizontal Centers". It should snap to center of the frame.
5. Next, turn on your rulers by going to `View > Show Rulers`.
6. Move your mouse over the ruler on the left edge of the design area until the cursor changes to a double-sided arrow. Click and drag to create a vertical ruler, positioning it over the left edge of the paragraph until it snaps. Repeat the procedure to create a ruler on the right edge of the paragraph.
7. Position and resize all the other text blocks using those same rulers until they all have the same width and position.

You should now have a single column of text, with paragraphs using optimal line lengths. In the next lesson, you're going to work out the vertical spacing between blocks of text. Keep this file handy.
