* The size and line height of your body copy is the heart of an internally consistent system
* This will focus on your base font size, and all other sizes will be based on the decisions you make here.
* Refer to [units of measure]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _basics/015-units-of-measure.md %})
* Start with system defaults (14, 16, 17), vary from there
* Font sizes should vary by device, but when starting out, pick sizes that work across a range of devices to minimize complexity
* Think about context: will the reader be reading lots of text? Or will they be reading sparingly? Mobile or desktop primarily?
* Look at a few examples. Designing a news site — look at a lot of news sites.

## Exercise
To complete this exercise, you will probably need to refer to the lesson on [units of measure]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _basics/015-units-of-measure.md %}).

1. In the [last exercise]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _typography/021-typography-picking-typefaces-2.md %}), you landed on a couple of typefaces you can use for heading and body copy. In this exercise, you're going to be picking a base font size which will inform all other sizing decisions. Open up the design document you've been working in for the past few lessons.
2. Select both of the paragraphs of text. Picking a base font size should take a few things into account:
  * System default — what is the system default? Readers will be used to default sizes, so it's a good starting place. System defaults tend to range from 14px - 18px. iOS uses 17pt, the web uses 16px, and Android uses a range of sizes, generally from 13sp-15sp.
  * Context — is the reader likely going to be using this at work? At home? On the go? Given we are designing for a reading-heavy fictional travel site that should work across a range of device widths[^2], we should optimize for larger text.
  * X-height — does the typeface you chose have a tall or short x-height? The shorter the x-height is, the larger you'll need to make your font size to ensure readability.
  * Brand — do similar brands use larger
