* This will focus on your base font size, and all other sizes will be based on the decisions you make here.
* Refer to [units of measure]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _basics/015-units-of-measure.md %})
* Start with system defaults (14, 16, 17), vary from there
* Font sizes should vary by device, but when starting out, pick sizes that work across a range of devices to minimize complexity
