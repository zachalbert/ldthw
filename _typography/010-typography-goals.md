## Exercise
In the following series of exercises you're going to design a typographic system
for a new travel magazine of your choosing. This first exercise will focus on
building inspiration and forming a clear picture of the goal you're trying to achieve.

1. Pick the niche you want your travel magazine to occupy. In the videos, we're going
to design for a more luxurious travel mag, but you can pick a different niche to challenge yourself.
2. In a new design document, paste several images of the type of travel this magazine will
write about. Also, paste images of other brands your readers will likely be accustomed to.
For our luxury travel mag, I found inspiration from luxury clothing, condo, and car makers.
3. This inspiration will help you derive a few terms that represent your typographic goals. Refer to the exercise
on [developing brand principles]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _basics/020-developing-principles.md %})
for more information on how to do this.
4. The typographic terms I ended up with are **minimalist**, **thin**, **highly modulated**. While the term minimalist doesn't refer specifically to typography, it conjures up a clear image in my mind â€” which is the most important part about picking these terms. Write these terms in your design file prominently so you can keep them in mind when designing.

Once you have your inspiration and abstract principles established, you're done. Keep this design file handy for the next lesson.
