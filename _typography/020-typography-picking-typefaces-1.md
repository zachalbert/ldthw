* difference between fonts and Typefaces
* Rules of thumb:
  * no more than 2 typefaces
  * use sufficient contrast between headings (aka display) and body copy. Common contrasts are serif + non-serif, condensed and regular.
  * The larger the font size, the more decorative your font can be. Body copy fonts should picked based on readability.
* Look at font pairing websites and existing design for inspiration.
* order:
* What's available, and in budget?
* What's the context where this will be read?
* What best meets the brand and type goals already established?
* Seeing is believing. You can't simply see another instance of type and know it'll work for you. Get it into your design app to play around with it. Use a matrix to see many instances together.

## Exercise
This is a difficult exercise to complete. Process will be provided, but you're going to have to go into this exercise with an [open and patient mind]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _basics/006-basics-mindset.md %}).

1. In the [last exercise]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _typography/015-typography-content-hierarchy.md %}), you laid out separate text blocks for each level of your content hierarchy. Open up that file, and move your inspiration and principles near the frame so you can easily see them. Refer back to them frequently throughout the following process. In this exercise, you're going to be picking typefaces for your headings and body copy.
2. Open up [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), or the font directory of your choice. Google Fonts have a diverse catalogue, and are free. There are a few paid options with very high quality fonts as well, like [Typekit](https://typekit.com/) (if you have an Adobe CC license), [Hoefler&Co's Cloud Typography](https://www.typography.com/cloud/welcome/), or the large library on [MyFonts](http://www.myfonts.com/). If you're unsure, stick with Google Fonts for now.
3. You're going to pick a typeface to use for headings first. Display typography has a lot more room for creative expression since heading sizes are larger and therefore easier to read. Start by typing your title "Traveling to Fiji" into any one of the example text cards in Google fonts. Click the "Apply to all fonts" link that appears after you edit the text. It's important to see the typefaces you're looking at in context.
4. Now, go through the catalogue and click the "plus" icon to select any font families that catch your eye. You're not going to be making a decision yet, you're just collecting options to look at later. Do your best to limit your selection to 5-10 at most to simplify the decision process later. 2-3 options is better.
5. When it comes to picking typefaces that "catch your eye," the best advice is to refer back to your inspiration frequently and use the filters Google Fonts provides. Ask yourself if the typeface you want to pick feels like it "belongs" with the images in your inspiration library. For instance, our inspiration uses a lot of large, highly modulated serif typefaces. So, select both **serif** and **display** categories. Also, try using the **thickness** filter to find options with lots of modulation.
6. You should also click on the name of typefaces that interest you to learn more about them. Sometimes, learning the history behind a typeface can help you a great deal. If you learn that a typeface was designed for a specific context that matches what you're designing for, that can give you greater confidence in your decisions.
7. Once you have at least 2-3 potential heading typefaces, repeat the same procedure to pick 2-3 potential body typefaces. Fonts used for body copy can be — and should be — a little more generic. The objective isn't to make a statement, but to serve the content. If a reader is constantly struggling to read the content because the font is creative but barely legible, then it's not doing its job.
8. Once you have a handful of typefaces picked out, click the drawer at the bottom of the page which tells you the number of font families you've selected. Click the "Customize" tab, and select as many styles for each font family as you can. You won't need to use all of them, but it's a good idea to have options. Click the download button in the upper right when you're done.
9. Once downloaded, install them. You may need to look up instructions on installing fonts for your particular system, as there are too many possibilities to provide instructions that will work for everyone.
10. If you are using the desktop version of Figma, you should be ready to go. If you're using Figma in a browser, you'll need to [follow these instructions](https://help.figma.com/text/using-local-fonts) to download and install a helper if you want to access your newly downloaded fonts in Figma.

In the next lesson, you're going to lay out the fonts you just downloaded to see them in context, then make a final selection. Keep this design document handy.
