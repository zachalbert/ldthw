You're finally ready to start looking at typefaces. There are a dizzying array of options, so in this lesson you'll learn a few tips that will help you limit your choices.

## Rules of Thumb

The follow rules *generally* apply, but like everything in design you can break the rules if you have a good reason.

### 2 Typefaces Max

While you will probably use many fonts in a given design, limit your typefaces to two at maximum. Usually, you should use one typeface for titles and headings, and another for body copy.

### Sufficient Contrast

When deciding which typefaces to pair with each other, make sure there is sufficient contrast between them. It's common to pair a sans-serif heading face with a serif body face, or vice versa. Avoid picking 2 different typefaces of a similar design to pair together, in the same way that it's a fashion best practice to avoid wearing two different types of plaid.

### Display vs Body

When picking a typeface for "display" purposes (where the intended use is titles, major headings, and anywhere you're using a larger font size), you can get significantly more creative and decorative with your choice. Since titles are meant to stand out and will typically have a very low character count, you can get away with a more idiosyncratic typeface.

However, when picking a typeface intended for body copy, optimize for legibility (aka make it more boring). A reader will spend the majority of their time reading body copy, and your goal should be to minimize eye strain and reduce the effect of reading fatigue.

### What's Your Budget?

Good typography costs money — *(usually)*. [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) has made many professional-quality typefaces available for use on the web for free. However, it's a limited subset of what you can get if you have a budget for typography.

A couple of non-free options with very high quality typography are [Typekit](https://www.typekit.com/) and [MyFonts](https://www.myfonts.com/), which aggregates many professional typefaces, and [Hoefler&Co](https://www.typography.com), a famous type foundry that has many high-quality options to choose from.

### Pairing Inspiration

Typeface pairing websites are popular for beginners who want to look at some easy pairing options. It's best not to rely on pairings you find exclusively, but they can be a great source of inspiration. [Google the phrase "font pairing"](https://www.google.com/search?q=font+pairing&oq=font+pairing) to find a list of possibilities. There are also font pairings that focus exclusively on fonts available from a specific source, such as [Font Pair](https://fontpair.co/).

### Brand

Once you've picked a source for where you'll find the typeface you're looking for, next you'll need to think about your brand. Look at your inspiration and goals as you look through typeface options, and think carefully about whether a certain style "fits" the brand image you're going for. The best way to make this determination is to look at lots of other design in the same style. What are the unique characteristics of the type used in those examples?

In this exercise, you're going to pick several typeface options. You won't make your final decision until the next lesson. Because of the ease of using Google Fonts in Figma documents, this exercise will focus on that as a source. However, as you grow your skills in design, experiment with other type sources in the future.

## Exercise
This is part 1 of a 2 part exercise on picking fonts. This is a difficult exercise to complete. I will give you a process, but you'll have to go into this exercise with an [open and patient mind]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _basics/006-basics-mindset.md %}).

1. In the [last exercise]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _typography/010-typography-content-hierarchy.md %}), you laid out separate text blocks for each level of your content hierarchy. Open up that file, and move your goals, inspiration, and observations about your inspiration near the frame so you can easily see them. Refer back to them frequently throughout the following process. In this exercise, you're going to be picking typefaces for your headings and body copy.
2. Open up [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), or the font directory of your choice.
3. You're going to pick a typeface to use for headings first. Display typography has a lot more room for creative expression since heading sizes are larger and therefore easier to read. Start by typing your title "Traveling to Fiji" into any one of the example text cards in Google fonts. Click the "Apply to all fonts" link that appears after you edit the text. It's important to see the typefaces you're looking at in context.
4. Now, go through the catalogue and click the "plus" icon to select any font families that catch your eye. You're not going to be making a decision yet, you're just collecting options to look at later. Do your best to limit your selection to ~5 at most to simplify the decision process later. 2-3 options is better, but never pick just a single option.
5. When it comes to picking typefaces that "catch your eye," the best advice is to refer back to your inspiration frequently and use the filters Google Fonts provides. Ask yourself if the typeface you want to pick feels like it "belongs" with the images in your inspiration library. For instance, our inspiration uses a lot of large, highly modulated serif typefaces. So, select both **serif** and **display** categories. Also, try using the **thickness** filter to find options with lots of modulation.
6. You should also click on the name of typefaces that interest you to learn more about them. Sometimes, learning the history behind a typeface can help you a great deal. If you learn that a typeface was designed for a specific context that matches what you're designing for, that can give you greater confidence in your decisions.
7. Once you have at least 2-3 potential heading typefaces, repeat the same procedure to pick 2-3 potential body typefaces. Fonts used for body copy can be — and should be — a little more generic. The objective isn't to make a statement, but to serve the content. If a reader is constantly struggling to read the content because the font is creative but barely legible, then it's not doing its job.
8. Once you've picked 2-5 options for both your headings and body copy, open the drawer at the bottom of Google Fonts to see what you selected. Create a text block for each heading and body face you chose and assign the correct typeface from the font selection menu in Figma. If you chose 2 heading faces and 3 body faces, then you should end up with 5 text blocks total.
9. You're now ready to move to the next lesson. However, if you ended up picking typefaces from your own computer or that you downloaded from another service, you'll need to install them before using them. If you're using the desktop app version of Figma, you will have access to any system font by default. If you're using Figma in a browser, you'll need to [follow these instructions](https://help.figma.com/text/using-local-fonts) to download and install a helper if you want to access your newly downloaded fonts in the Figma web interface.

In the next lesson, you're going to lay out the fonts you just downloaded to see them in context, then make a final selection. Keep this design document handy.
