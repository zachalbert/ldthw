* Why these classifiers are useful
* Basic type anatomy, and why they're important (x height, cap height, modulation, terminals + serifs)
* Basic type classification using Vox-ATypeI — broad categories

It's time to start thinking about which typefaces you're going to pick. This lesson will remain somewhat abstract, which is going to help when you make your decision. Picking typefaces can be overwhelming, so this step is important to whittle down your choices.

### Classification

There have been several attempts over the years to classify typography based on the visual characteristics of the letters, in the same way that scientists have created systems to classify plants and animals.

You're going to learn briefly about one of the more popular classification systems — Vox-ATypI (which is a combination of the name of its creator — Maximilien Vox, and the Association Typographique Internationale which adopted it in 1962). It isn't the only one, but is a good starting place.

### Vox-ATypeI

This classification system groups typefaces into 14 categories, within 3 broader groups: classicals, moderns, and calligraphics.

1	Classicals
1.1	Humanist

2.2	Mechanistic
2.3	Lineal
2.3.1	Grotesque
2.3.2	Neo-grotesque
2.3.3	Geometric
2.3.4	Humanist
3	Calligraphics
3.1	Glyphic
3.2	Script
3.3	Graphic

## Exercise
In this exercise, you're going to identify the typographic characteristics of the inspiration you've gathered. It's not necessary that you know every detail of the Vox-ATypeI classification system, but it will make it easier for you to find similar typefaces in upcoming lessons.

1. Open the design document you began in the [last lesson]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _typography/005-typography-goals-inspiration.md %}). Also, open a browser window to [Wikipedia's entry on Vox-ATypeI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox-ATypI_classification).
2. Read through each of the descriptions and try to pick the classification which most closely matches the typography in your inspiration. Write the relevant categories down.
3. Also, take note of any specific [typographic anatomy](http://typedia.com/learn/only/anatomy-of-a-typeface/) that seems unique, even if you don't know the official terminology. For example, take note of the serif style, the x-height of the letters, the amount of modulation in the strokes, or the slant of the letterforms. Write down anything you notice near where you've captured your goals and inspiration. This will make it easier to pick typefaces that feel similar in spirit to your inspiration.

You're done when you've captured some details about the typographic inspiration you've chosen. Keep this file handy for the next exercise, where you're going to start laying out your blocks of text.
