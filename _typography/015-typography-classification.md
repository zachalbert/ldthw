It's time to start thinking about which typefaces you're going to pick. Before you do, it's a good idea to pick a *category* of typeface first based on the goals you have, which will narrow down your possible choices. There are an overwhelming number of typefaces available to designers today.

### Classification

There have been several attempts over the years to classify typography based on the visual characteristics of the letters, in the same way that scientists have created systems to classify plants and animals.

You're going to learn briefly about one of the more popular classification systems — Vox-ATypI (which is a combination of the name of its creator — Maximilien Vox, and the Association Typographique Internationale which adopted it in 1962). It isn't the only classification system, but is a helpful starting place.

## Vox-ATypeI

This classification system groups typefaces into 3 main groups: classicals, moderns, and calligraphics, with subgroups within those for a total of 14 (15 if you consider the addition of a broad non-latin character group).

It's worth noting that while a given category of typeface may have been originally created during a certain time period, revivals of old typefaces are continuously being created. Contemporary typographers may even create new type that combine multiple styles in order to achieve a unique effect.

### Classicals

Classicals represent many faces originally created during the enlightenment era, and are characterized by relatively lower contrast in stroke width (called modulation), triangular serifs, and a slanted axis. The axis is the angle which a calligraphic pen is held at, which dictates where the thick and thin parts of a letterform are located.

**Pick a classical typeface when your goal is to evoke a traditional, literary, human, or religious feeling. Avoid if you're trying to evoke something more contemporary.**

#### 1. Humanist

These typefaces were originally created in the 15th century, and were designed to mimic formal calligraphy in medieval manuscripts. Distinctive characteristics are a slanted crossbar on the lowercase "e", a slanted axis, pointed serifs on ascenders, and lower stroke modulation.

Examples include Centaur and Cloister.

#### 2. Garalde

A more common, well-proportioned, higher contrast instance of classical humanist typefaces, Garaldes are still commonly used today.

Examples include Garamond and Bembo.

#### 3. Transitional (aka Realist)

These typefaces are the most common Classicals still in use today. The axis is more vertical and stroke modulation is higher.

Examples include the ubiquitous Times New Roman and Baskerville.

### Moderns

The "modern" category of type came about with the advent of the industrial age, and is characterized by a more functional, geometric feel. The modern group also includes the "lineal" sub-group, which contains the significantly more utilitarian sans-serif typefaces.

**Pick a modern typeface when your goal is to evoke a more contemporary or industrial feeling. Avoid if you're trying to show the human element in a brand.**

#### 4. Didone

These typefaces are characterized by dramatic modulation (generally, extremely thin horizontal strokes and serifs paired with extremely thick vertical strokes), and a more vertical axis. These are often used in branding for fashion, theater, and other brands that attempt to convey a sense of drama.

Examples include Didot and Bodoni.

#### 5. Mechanistic

These typefaces show more of the mechanical side of modern typefaces.

#### Lineals (aka Sans-Serif)

These typefaces do not use serifs on the end of strokes, which was a significant break from tradition. Though sans-serif looks normal to the contemporary eye, serifs were originally cut to mimic chisel marks in stone engravings from classical Greek and Roman architecture. The lack of serif was initially seen as brutish, which is why the term "grotesque" was often applied to this grouping.

**Modern Lineals (aka "Geometric Sans-serif") are often used for tech company branding. Pick these typefaces when your goal is to evoke a machine-like quality.**

##### 6. Grotesque

##### 7. Neo-Grotesque

##### 8. Geometric

##### 9. Humanist

### Calligraphics

These typefaces mimic the human hand more than other categories, whether the type was hand drawn or digitally created. This category is the most visually diverse.

#### 10. Glyphic

#### 11. Script

#### 12. Graphic

#### 13. Blackletter

#### 14. Gaelic

### Non-Latin

A broad category of typefaces that use non-latin alphabets such as Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew, and east Asian languages like Japanese, Chinese, Korean, etc.

## Exercise
In this exercise, you're going to identify the typographic characteristics of the inspiration you've gathered. It's not necessary that you know every detail of the Vox-ATypeI classification system, but it will make it easier for you to find similar typefaces in upcoming lessons.

1. Open the design document you began in the [last lesson]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _typography/005-typography-goals-inspiration.md %}). Also, open a browser window to [Wikipedia's entry on Vox-ATypeI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox-ATypI_classification).
2. Read through each of the descriptions and try to pick the classification which most closely matches the typography in your inspiration. Write the relevant categories down.
3. Also, take note of any specific [typographic anatomy](http://typedia.com/learn/only/anatomy-of-a-typeface/) that seems unique, even if you don't know the official terminology. For example, take note of the serif style, the x-height of the letters, the amount of modulation in the strokes, or the slant of the letterforms. Write down anything you notice near where you've captured your goals and inspiration. This will make it easier to pick typefaces that feel similar in spirit to your inspiration.

You're done when you've captured some details about the typographic inspiration you've chosen. Keep this file handy for the next exercise, where you're going to start laying out your blocks of text.
