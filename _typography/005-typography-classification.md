## Exercise
1. For each of the broad categories (classical, modern, and calligraphic), pick one corresponding typeface from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
2. Download and install them manually. Sky fonts is a convenient way of keeping your fonts in sync, but only once you know how to install them manually. Because the instructions for downloading and installing fonts from Google may change, following the instructions from [this page](https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq#can_i_download_the_fonts_on_google_fonts_to_my_own_computer).
