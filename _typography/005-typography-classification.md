* Why these classifiers are useful
* Basic type anatomy, and why they're important (x height, cap height, modulation, terminals + serifs)
* Basic type classification using Vox-ATypeI â€” broad categories

## Exercise

# REDO THIS LESSON. Make it more about identifying the categories used in the inspiration, potentially reordering after the type goals lesson.

1. For each of the broad categories (classical, modern, and calligraphic), pick one corresponding typeface from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). Click the plus icon to select the ones you want.
2. When you've selected 3 families, open the dialog that appeared on the bottom of the page. Go to the "Customize" tab and select all font styles (such as bold, regular, italic, etc.). Some font families will have many styles, some will only have one. It's a good idea to grab all of them so you can try them out.
3. Download and install the fonts manually. Sky fonts is a convenient way of keeping your fonts in sync, but only once you know how to install them manually. Because the instructions for downloading and installing fonts from Google may change, following the instructions from [this help page](https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq#can_i_download_the_fonts_on_google_fonts_to_my_own_computer).
4. Once downloaded, installing them requires you to either open all the font files and click install, or move them to your local font folder. You may need to google instructions for your specific operating system if you hit a snag.
5. If you are using the desktop version of Figma, you should be ready to go. If you're using Figma in a browser, you'll need to [follow these instructions](https://help.figma.com/text/using-local-fonts) to download and install a helper.
6. Once you've installed those fonts, try using them in Figma to make sure it works. You may need to restart / reload Figma if you don't see the fonts in your list.

You've now learned the basics of working with typography in Figma, and how to download, install, and use new fonts. Though you haven't done anything especially fancy yet, you're going to learn how to create a typographic system in the next series of lessons. You don't need to save this design file.
