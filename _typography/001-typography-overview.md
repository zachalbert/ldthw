## Exercise
This exercise will take you through a few basics of working with type in Figma.

1. Open a new design document. This will be a scratchpad, which you won't need to repurpose for future lessons.
2. With the <span data-keyCombo="text">text tool</span> selected, click once to create an auto-resizing text block. Paste the following lorem ipsum text: `Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nullam commodo rhoncus dapibus.`
3. An auto-width text block will continually expand or contract based on the amount of text. Convert this text block to a fixed-width block by dragging one of the drag handles on the corner of a selected text block. Force the text to wrap to 2 lines by making the text block more narrow.
4. Next, increase the size of the text to 18, and make it center-aligned.
5. Now increase the line height of the text to 150%. You can access the line height underneath the font size selector. Hover your mouse over each input in the text section of the design panel if you're having trouble finding it.
6. Increase the letter spacing to 5%.
7. Finally, make the text all caps. While you can do this manually by typing with caps lock, let Figma do the hard work for you. Under the ellipsis menu to the right of the "Text" heading in the design panel, look for the **Uppercase** button underneath the **Transform** heading.

This was a brief overview of some of the things you can do to text in Figma, which will prepare you for what you're going to be doing in the upcoming lessons. You don't need to save this file.
