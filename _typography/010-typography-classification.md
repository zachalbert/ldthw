* Why these classifiers are useful
* Basic type anatomy, and why they're important (x height, cap height, modulation, terminals + serifs)
* Basic type classification using Vox-ATypeI â€” broad categories

## Exercise
In this exercise, you're going to identify the typographic characteristics of the inspiration you've gathered. It's not necessary that you know every detail of the Vox-ATypeI classification system, but it will make it easier for you to find similar typefaces in upcoming lessons.

1. Open the design document you began in the [last lesson]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _typography/005-typography-goals-inspiration.md %}). Also, open a browser window to [Wikipedia's entry on Vox-ATypeI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox-ATypI_classification).
2. Read through each of the descriptions and try to pick the classification which most closely matches the typography in your inspiration. Write the relevant categories down.
3. Also, take note of any specific [typographic anatomy](http://typedia.com/learn/only/anatomy-of-a-typeface/) that seems unique, even if you don't know the official terminology. For example, take note of the serif style, the x-height of the letters, the amount of modulation in the strokes, or the slant of the letterforms. Write down anything you notice near where you've captured your goals and inspiration. This will make it easier to pick typefaces that feel similar in spirit to your inspiration.

You're done when you've captured some details about the typographic inspiration you've chosen. Keep this file handy for the next exercise, where you're going to start laying out your blocks of text.
