* Seeing is believing. You can't simply see another instance of type and know it'll work for you. Get it into your design app to play around with it. Use a matrix to see many instances together.

## Exercise
1. In the [last exercise]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _typography/020-typography-picking-typefaces-1.md %}), you downloaded a handful of font options to select from. In this exercise, you're going to narrow down your options to 1 or 2.
2. In design, but typography especially, seeing is believing. Once you can see your typefaces used in context, you'll have an easier time making a decision. Start by opening up the design document where you laid out your content hierarchy.
3. Select the title and subtitle blocks, then change the font to the first heading font you downloaded and installed. Select all other text blocks, and change them to use one of your body copy fonts.
4. Once done, select the frame and <span data-keyCombo="duplicate">duplicate</span> it. That will create a duplicate to the right. Create as many duplicates as you have potential body typefaces. Body font styles should most likely use the "regular" or "roman" style, rather than one of the bold, light, or italic styles. If you picked 3 body copy fonts, you should have 3 frames.
5. For each frame, change the body fonts to use each font you downloaded.
6. Once you've done that, select all the frames, and `alt/option` drag down to create duplicate frames underneath. Create as many duplicates as you have possible display fonts. For each new row of frames, change the title and subtitle text in each frame to use your display font options — 1 for each row.
7. When finished, you should have a matrix of frames with 1 heading font option for each row, and 1 body font option for each column. This will show you every possible combination of fonts to pick from. You may also want to create additional variations to account for different heading font weights, such as a row for "Roboto Light" and "Roboto Black". Don't go crazy with this — any more than about 10 frames will become unruly.
8. You've been following the [divergent/convergent process]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _basics/025-diverge-converge.md %}) by creating many divergent options. You now need to converge on the best combination of typefaces. Look at your inspiration and type principles, then look at the first frame. Does it seem to fit your goals? If the answer is a clear no, then quickly delete the frame without a second thought. If it *might* fit your principles but you're not sure yet, then leave the frame alone. If it *definitely* fits your principles, then draw a star or some other symbol in one of the corners. Go through all your frames in this manner.
9. Repeat this process until you've arrived at a maximum of 2-3 frames. Making your final decision is difficult, but here are a few strategies you can use to help:
  * Leave your design document open on your computer so it's the first thing you see when you log in, and sleep on it. Sometimes a little bit of distance can make a difficult decision much easier.
  * Get critique from another designer, or failing that, ask non-designers for their opinions. Remember to [take feedback well]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _basics/030-critique-taking-feedback.md %}).
  * Research the history of the typefaces in question. Sometimes, the history of a typeface is enough to sway you.
  * If you've done all those things and *still* can't decide, flip a coin and remember you can change your decision later. This might seem like silly advice, but if you've gone through all the previous steps, then you're likely overanalyzing. Make a random choice so you can maintain your momentum.

I picked "Playfair Display" for my heading fonts (bold for the title and regular for the subtitle), "Verlag Book" for paragraph text and "Verlag Light" for H3s. I altered the weights to reinforce the hierarchy of the content.

Once you've picked a pair of typefaces and have found the right weights for each level of your content hierarchy, you're ready to move on to the next lesson. Congratulations — the hardest part is over! Hang on to this design file so you can use it in the next lesson.
