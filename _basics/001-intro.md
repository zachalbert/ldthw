  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist%27s_Creed
    * I believe that clear thinking and clear statement, accuracy and fairness are fundamental to good journalism.
    * I believe that a journalist should write only what he holds in his heart to be true.
    * I believe that advertising, news and editorial columns should alike serve the best interests of readers; that a single standard of helpful truth and cleanness should prevail for all; that the supreme test of good journalism is the measure of its public service.
    * I believe that no one should write as a journalist what he would not say as a gentleman; that bribery by one’s own pocketbook is as much to be avoided as bribery by the pocketbook of another; that individual responsibility may not be escaped by pleading another’s instructions or another’s dividends.
    * I believe that the journalism which succeeds best — and best deserves success — fears God and honors Man; is stoutly independent, unmoved by pride of opinion or greed of power, constructive, tolerant but never careless, self-controlled, patient, always respectful of its readers but always unafraid, is quickly indignant at injustice; is unswayed by the appeal of privilege or the clamor of the mob; seeks to give every man a chance and, as far as law and honest wage and recognition of human brotherhood can make it so, an equal chance; is profoundly patriotic while sincerely promoting international good will and cementing world-comradeship; is a journalism of humanity, of and for today’s world.
* Keeping machine in working order, and supplies on hand
* Make all effort to validate, and perform user Research
* Truth
* White hat, etc.

1. Personal Responsibility — To the extent that I have a hand in creating something, I am responsible for it.
2. Social Good Above All — I prioritize the greatest good for the greatest number, over personal or professional gain.
3. Never Build Evil — At all costs, I avoid building up anything that is detrimental to human society.
4. The highest aim of design is to increase the benefit for the greatest number of people.
