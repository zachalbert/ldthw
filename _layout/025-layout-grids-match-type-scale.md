In this exercise, you're going to set up new frames that mirror a typographic system. I'll provide you with a typographic system to use, but make sure you've gone through [the lessons on typography](LINKME) to understand how typographic systems are created.

The main measurement in a typographic system that you should care about for layout purposes is your line height, or leading.

Use leading to arrive at gutter widths and row heights.

Set up a new [type scale template](LINKME to the typography exercise where you draw out H1s, H2s, etc), and use up your type using these settings:

18px / 24px (1.333)
